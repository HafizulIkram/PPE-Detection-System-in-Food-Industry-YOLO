Ensuring safety and hygiene in the food industry is crucial to prevent contamination and safeguard public health, with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) playing a key role. However, compliance with PPE protocols remains challenging. The develop system is build using deep learning-based automated detection systems to monitor PPE compliance among food operators, aiming to enhance safety standards and prevent foodborne illnesses.
