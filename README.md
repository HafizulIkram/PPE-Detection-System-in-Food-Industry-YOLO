# PPE-Detection-System-in-Food-Industry-YOLO

Ensuring safety and hygiene in the food industry is crucial to prevent contamination and safeguard public health, with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) playing a key role. However, compliance with PPE protocols remains challenging. The develop system is build using deep learning-based automated detection systems to monitor PPE compliance among food operators, aiming to enhance safety standards and prevent foodborne illnesses.

## Features

- **Image Detection**: The system accurately detects and classifies PPE attire in images based on compliance settings. It can identify various types of PPE such as gloves, aprons, hairnets, face masks, and footwear.
- **Webcam Detection**: Real-time detection of PPE using webcam feeds, allowing continuous monitoring and immediate compliance checks.
